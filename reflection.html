      <h1 class="page-title">My Growing Pain</h1>

      <p class="reflection-text">
        One thing I struggled the most during coding was styling. There are too many adjustable
elements. When my code doesn't work, I usually ask Howard. If Howard is not beside me, I will ask my
beloved chat gpt. Wireframing felt easier than coding because it's just the outline/blueprint of the website. Its
way easier to drag and put something than coding. One thing I learned about myself while learning to code is I’m not good at it. I tend to forget
most of the coding elements and specialties.

      <h3 class="response-title">Do you feel that you know more of what or how to ask ChatGPT now?</h3>

      <p>I now know what to ask and how to ask ChatGPT instead of just throwing random questions at it and hoping for magic. I've learned that the clearer and more specific my question is, the better the answer I get. Before, I treated ChatGPT like a guessing game. Now, I treat it more like a very fast, very patient assistant who actually works better when I give clear instructions.
